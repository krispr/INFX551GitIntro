Approximately 88% of recent spawners have been returns from the Kendall Creek Hatchery rebuilding program (including off-station releases at acclimation sites). Carcass recoveries (and spawning locations) correlate with release locations, so upper basin releases are influencing the primary spawning locations. Spawning also occurs in the lower North Fork. Various tributaries are also used, including Canyon, Racehorse, Boulder, Maple, Cornell, Deadhorse, Thompson and Boyd creeks. Spawning also occurs in the Middle Fork Nooksack, including Canyon Lake Creek.

This population includes steelhead in Oregon in the North and South Forks of the Walla Walla, and Couse Creek, as well as Washington and Oregon portions of Cottonwood Creek, Birch Creek, Pine Creek, Mill Creek and many other tributaries (including Dry Creek in WA).  This population is distinct and managed separately from the steelhead in the Touchet River drainage.","Steelhead spawning surveys have been conducted annually (or at least frequently) in portions of Mill Creek. Less frequent (periodic) spawning surveys have been conducted in many of the tributaries (e.g. Cottonwood and upper Dry creeks) or portions of the mainstem river to help determine spawning distribution and relative adult steelhead abundance.  A fish counting station/trap at Nursery Bridge Dam near Milton-Freewater currently provide the best index of returning adult steelhead abundance.  Counts from that location are expanded by a constant rate of 1.503 to provide an estimate for steelhead thought to be present in both the Walla Walla River and Mill Creek combined.  Video counts at fish ladders in Mill Creek or in Yellowhawk Creek provide partial counts of returning steelhead to those areas. Extensive electrofishing and snorkel surveys have been conducted by WDFW and Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) to determine distribution, species composition and relative abundance during summer low flow periods. This effort includes several fish salvage efforts as portions of the stream channel have been dewatered. CTUIR operates several smolt traps in the Walla Walla River and Mill Creek to estimate smolt production and timing, and to allow PIT tagging of migratory salmonids. CTUIR has also conducted radio telemetry studies of steelhead, bull trout and spring Chinook in the Walla Walla Basin. Only expanded Nursery Bridge Dam counts are reported here.","Primary spawning areas include the upper Walla Walla River and it tributaries (e.g. Couse Creek and North Fork Walla Walla), upper Mill and upper Dry creeks, plus in numerous small tributaries such as Cottonwood Creek, Yellowhawk Creek and Blue Creek.","Recent genetic analysis (Small 2003b, Blankenship et al. 2007, Narum et al. 2004 and Blankenship et al. 2009) indicates that naturallyspawning summer steelhead from the Walla Walla Basin (collections from the upper Walla Walla, Mill Creek and Yellowhawk Creek) are distinct from those in the Touchet River (Hatchery or wild) and the Snake River (Tucannon River wild and hatchery-origin and Lyons Ferry Hatchery).

The Toutle River enters the Cowlitz River at RM 20. Due to limited genetic and biological data all Toutle cutthroat are currently considered to be part of one stock complex. Anadromous, resident, fluvial, and adfluvial forms distribute themselves throughout the watershed. The anadromous form has access to most of the watershed with the exception of upper tributary reaches, where a combination of steep gradient and high flow limits passage. The resident and fluvial forms have been observed throughout the system. Adfluvial fish have been observed in Silver Lake.","There are no population-size data, only distribution data, for resident Toutle cutthroat, so the status of this life history form cannot be assessed.  Anadromous cutthroat are counted at the North Toutle Hatchery. In 1959 a total of 74 wild anadromous cutthroat were captured at this facility during coho and chinook brood stock collections (Lavier 1960). After the reopening of this facility in 1991, annual counts have remained below six fish. There have been trap changes between 1959 and 1991, and the trap is not 100% effective for anadromous cutthroat. Columbia River cutthroat sport catch data from 1972 to 1995 from a survey conducted to estimate salmon and steelhead catch are also available (Leider 1997). Some sampling inconsistencies were apparent in the early to mid-1970s, and in some years sampling was incomplete. More restrictive angling regulations, implemented during the survey, also appear to have reduced cutthroat catch, but the extent of this reduction has not been determined.  The catch between 1971 and 1991 was composed of both hatchery and wild fish. Small samples from this fishery were collected between 1979 and 1982. Tipping (1982) found that 20% of the catch was wild (n=31). Sampling in 1979 and 1980 indicated that","As with other wild Columbia River anadromous cutthroat, entry to the Columbia River commences in late July and continues through mid-April. Entry to the Cowlitz occurs slightly later. Entry into the North Fork Toutle peaks between September to November with a smaller number of fish moving throughout the winter (Loch, WDFW, personal communication April 1994).  Spawning activity occurs from January through June. Fluvial and resident spawning times have not been documented in this watershed but are believed to be similar to the anadromous spawning time. Anadromous spawn time was taken from wild anadromous cutthroat captured from Green River, Elochoman River, and Nemah River and held at Vancouver Hatchery and Beaver Creek Hatchery (Lavier 1960).

Abernathy, Germany, Mill, and Coal creeks enter the Columbia River between RM 53 and RM 56.  Due to the proximity of these streams, their similar sizes and drainage characteristics, and the limited biological information available for them, cutthroat in these creeks have been combined into one stock complex.  Anadromous, resident, and fluvial forms distribute themselves throughout these watersheds. The anadromous form has access to most of the watersheds with the exception of upper tributary reaches where a combination of steep gradient and high flow can limit passage, and the areas above the falls on Slide and Cameron creeks (tributaries of Abernathy Creek). The resident forms have been observed throughout the system.","Wild anadromous escapement has been measured between zero and ten fish since 1991. Although surveys have not attempted to estimate trends among the various life history forms, it is thought these totals represent mainly anadromous and fluvial types. The trap on Abernathy Creek is operated to collect Chinook salmon, and to make the escapement estimates of coho and steelhead. Its efficiency for cutthroat is unknown. Columbia River cutthroat sport catch data from 1972 to 1995 are available from a survey conducted to estimate salmon and steelhead catch, but cutthroat trout catches were reported as well.  Some sampling inconsistencies were apparent in the early to mid-1970s, and in some years sampling was incomplete. More restrictive angling regulations, implemented during the survey, also appear to have reduced cutthroat catch, but the extent of this reduction has not been determined. Angler tag recoveries for Cowlitz Hatchery anadromous cutthroat in this area are high, indicating that Abernathy Creek stocks contribute to the catch in this area.  This stock is not currently monitored.","The data on anadromous cutthroat are limited, but we believe that the timing of stream entry and spawning in Abernathy, Germany, Mill, and Coal creeks is similar to that of Elochoman fish, which enter the river from late July through mid-April, with peak entry in the fall and spawning from January through April. Fluvial and resident spawning times have not been documented in this watershed but are believed to be similar to the anadromous spawning time.","Genetic data are unavailable for this stock.

There is no record of hatchery cutthroat releases into this drainage.,"Grays coastal cutthroat are classified as a distinct stock complex based on the geographic distribution of their spawning grounds. Grays River enters the Columbia River at RM 21.  Anadromous, resident and fluvial life history forms distribute themselves throughout the watershed. The anadromous form has access to most of the watershed with the exception of upper tributary reaches, where a combination of steep gradient and high flow can limit passage. The resident forms have been observed throughout the system.  As with other wild Columbia River coastal cutthroat, entry to the Columbia River commences in July and continues through the fall.","Columbia River recreational catch estimates from RM 0 to RM 38 were collected during a survey conducted from 1972 to 1995 to estimate salmon and steelhead catch, but cutthroat trout were also recorded. No distinctions among life history forms were made, but the numbers probably represent mainly anadromous and fluvial fish. Because the survey targeted salmon and steelhead, changes in angling effort for cutthroat cannot be quantified. Some sampling inconsistencies were apparent in the early to mid-1970s, and in some years sampling was incomplete. More restrictive angling regulations, implemented during the survey, also appear to have reduced cutthroat catch, but the extent of this reduction has not been determined.  The catch between 1971 and 1991 was composed of both hatchery and wild fish. Small samples from this fishery were collected between 1979 and 1982. Tipping (1982) found that 20% of the catch was wild (n = 31). Sampling in 1979 and 1980 indicated that 50% of the catch was wild. Columbia River estuary sampling in 1981 indicated that 21% of the sample (n = 141) was wild (Loch 1982). Columbia River catch data suggest a decline in cutthroat abundance over time.","The data on Grays River anadromous cutthroat are limited, but we believe that the timing of river entry and spawning is similar to that of Elochoman fish which enter the river from late July through Mid-April, with peak entry in the fall and spawning from January through April.
